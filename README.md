Disected Backbone fork { v1.0.0 }

## This fork
Just a disassembled Backbone to be able to work with the parts seppararedly.  

## Status
* I added some small modifications to some of the parts to experiment with different slim builds of the library.  
* Parts are taken appart and re-assembled with `grunt-rigger`.
* The "untouched" library works just fine after re-assembling.
* Slim only view and model build also works.
*Some attempts to rempve the ajax sync functionallity are now working

â€¦see the different builds inside the dist directory.
